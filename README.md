# Notes App
The web-based notes application is a user-friendly platform that provides a seamless experience for adding, editing, and deleting notes. It is a straightforward tool that allows users to quickly jot down their thoughts and ideas, organize their notes, and easily make changes as needed. With its intuitive interface and versatile functionality, this notes application is an efficient way to keep track of important information.

## Installation
To run this application, simply download the code and open the index.html file in your web browser.

## Usage
The application consists of two main parts: a sidebar containing a list of notes and a preview pane where the contents of the selected note are displayed.

To create a new note, click the "Add Note" button in the sidebar. To edit an existing note, simply click on its title in the sidebar. To delete a note, double-click on its title in the sidebar.

To search for a note, type your query into the search bar at the top of the sidebar.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into two main files: `main.js` and `style.css`.

`main.js` contains the JavaScript code that controls the behavior of the application. It defines two classes: `NotesView` and `NotesAPI`. `NotesView` is responsible for rendering the user interface, while `NotesAPI` provides an interface for interacting with the browser's local storage.

`style.css` contains the `CSS` code that defines the look and feel of the application.
